## Option 1 Install InSpec (Package installer)
First things first: We need InSpec on our workstation. For production and standalone environments, I recommend the ChefDK package, since it gives you Chef + Test-Kitchen + InSpec. You can download the package from [https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk](https://downloads.chef.io/chefdk).

## Option 2 Install InSpec (Terminal install)
Another option is to install InSpec via a command line script:

```
$ curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -channel stable -P chefdk
```

## After Install
Once InSpec is installed, run `inspec version` to verify that the installation was successful.
