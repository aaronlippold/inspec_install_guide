## Instructions

First things first, we need InSpec on our workstation. For production and standalone environments, the InSpec omnibus package gives you the bare minimum of what you need. This can be manually installed from a downloaded package or installed using a handy installer script provided by Chef.

### Option 1: Manual installation

This option is best when working in an air-gapped environment. Downloading the latest package files for InSpec from [Chef's downloads page](https://downloads.chef.io/inspec) will allow you to transfer the installers where you need them to go, then, depending on the operating system, install them in the platform-appropriate manner.

### Option 2: Automated installation

Another option is to install InSpec via a command line script, provided and maintained by Chef. This will only work if your firewall does not restrict WAN access to the following domains:

- `omnitruck.chef.io`
- `packages.chef.io`

Unix/Linux/Mac:

```
$ curl https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.sh | sudo bash -s -- -c stable -P inspec -v 3
```

Windows:

```
$ . { iwr -useb https://omnitruck.chef.io/install.ps1 } | iex; install -channel stable -project inspec -version 3
```

### After Install

Once InSpec is installed, run `inspec version` to verify that the installation was successful.
